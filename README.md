## A short fable of software engineering vs. regular engineering

```
I wonder how many years until software production will reach the level of maturity where we donâ€™t
just fix bugs but, when bugs happen, we stop in our tracks, shocked that bugs happened at all in
the first place, and only proceed after we had a serious look at our processes
```
Well, the answer, while relatively simple, is "hard" to implement because it envolves enforcing (rather than reaching) said maturity. And how is this maturity defined? Software engineers call it best practices. It really should be obligatory practices, but not every workplace is the same, the same way not every factory resists the passing of time.
